# inventory-manager

<h4>This web app was created and designed for a client at Boston University for use in the Questrom School of Business to track purchasing, intake, and warranty information.</h4>


It is a full-stack app, using the following languages:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

There is currently, not a public version to demonstrate functionality.  I am currently sanitizing and creating several datasets to use without jeopardizing actual serial numbers or private information.  Upon completion, a link will be added.


<h5> This was the first web app built from the ground up by myself. </h5>
